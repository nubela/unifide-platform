[SHPAML]

This package uses SHPAML as a transcompilable middleman language for HTML. (Because HTML is too verbose)
You can learn more about SHPAML at http://shpaml.com/#Shpaml

How to dev with SHPAML
----------------------

1. You need a watcher to monitor *.SHPAML files when they are modified
   You can use the one at https://github.com/nubela/transcompiler-watcher.git
2. Add a WATCHER.sh script in your folder, the code is as follows:

#!/bin/bash
python /Users/nubela/Workspace/transcompiler-watcher/src/watch.py /Users/nubela/Workspace/unifide-platform/client

3. Run it by doing ./WATCHER.sh
4. Feel free to modify it, it also watches for SASS files too.
